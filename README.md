# Countdown-App
## Intro
Countdown-App decrements the chosen date to get in touch, in an interactive way, with a giveaway deadline.

## Input
To setup Countdown-App, the application needs to be served to your browser before fulfilling the dialog box.

This dialog box will ask to enter a deadline in the following format:

> DATE MONTH YEAR HOUR:MINUTES

To work properly the "MONTH" has to be written in letters like : "Jan", "Feb", "Mar", etc .. as it is mentioned in the [RFC 2822 IETF.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2822#page-14)

Then press "OK" to proceed.

## Output
Once done the deadline will be updated in the giveaway description as well as in the countdown boxes that started decrementing.

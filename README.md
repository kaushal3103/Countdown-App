This dialog box will ask to enter a deadline in the following format:

> DATE MONTH YEAR HOUR:MINUTES

To work properly the "MONTH" has to be written in letters like : "Jan", "Feb", "Mar", etc .. as it is mentioned in the [RFC 2822 IETF.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2822#page-14)

Then press "OK" to proceed.

## Output
Once done the deadline will be updated in the giveaway description as well as in the countdown boxes that started decrementing.
